## About this project

This project is the frontend of Tramont's online shop. 

## Frontend

React + JavaScript + Context API + CSS

This project was created with `create-react-app`. Context API was used to manage states. Vanilla CSS was chosen to style the application and the CSS modules were the preferred approach.

## Features

### * Landing page:
Provides an overview of products and categories, providing the user with a starting point.
### * Products page: 
Users can browse through products. Only the price is displayed below the product image. The client's preference is to follow a highly minimalistic approach. 
### * Product details page: 
All product details are shown on this page, allowing the user to select color and size if the product offers that possibility.
### * Search for product: 
The search bar in the navigation bar looks for all the products matching a given word. All the products matching it will be displayed in the results.
### * Shopping Cart:
- The shopping cart floats to the right. 
- Is accessible anywhere in the application in order to allow the customer to keep track of it without interrupting the shopping flow, increasing sales and providing a better user experience. 
- It is also resizable for the convenience of the user's screen.
### * Payment Page: 
Stripe provides a checkout page, where the total value can be checked before choosing a payment method and proceeding to payment.

## Responsiveness

This project is mobile responsive. It works well on 390px wide screens. On other screens, it might not fit perfectly yet.
