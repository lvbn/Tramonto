## About this project

This project is the frontend of Tramont's online shop. 

## Frontend

React + JavaScript + Context API + CSS

This project was created with `create-react-app`. Context API was used to manage states. Vanilla CSS was chosen to style the application and the CSS modules were the preferred approach.

## Features

### * Landing page:
Provides an overview of products and categories, providing the user with a starting point.
### * products page: 
Users can browse through products. Only the price is displayed below the product image. The client's preference is to follow a highly minimalistic approach. 
### * Shopping Cart:
- The shopping cart floats to the right. 
- Is accessible anywhere in the application in order to allow the customer to keep track of it without interrupting the shopping flow, increasing sales and providing a better user experience. 
- It is also resizable for the convenience of the user's screen.

## Available Scripts
